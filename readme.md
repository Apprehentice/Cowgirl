Cowgirl
=======
Cowgirl is a Lua object filtration module written with the LÃ–VE framework in mind. This module will take a list of Lua objects and sort through them, removing any items do not match the given criteria.

## Filters ##
Cowgirl sorts items using functions called filters. A filter receives, in order, the Cowgirl object, the object being processed, the name of the filter, and the value to compare the object with. If the object passes the filter, the filter should return **true**. Otherwise, it should return **false**.

```Lua
function filter(self, object, name, value)
  return object.foo == value
end
```

By default, a Cowgirl object has two filters: *not* and *or*, both of which take a separate list of criteria. Cowgirl objects do not have, nor do they need, an *and* filter as criteria are implicitly exclusive.

## Usage ##
To use Cowgirl, require the module into your project and create a new Cowgirl object.
```Lua
local cowgirl = require("cowgirl")()
```

Once the new object is created, you can add filters to it and use it to process a list of items.
```Lua
local cowgirl = require("cowgirl")()

cowgirl:addFilter("foo", function(self, object, name, value)
  return object.foo == value
end)

local t = {
  {
    foo = "bar",
    a = "a",
    2 = "two"
  },
  {
    foo = "foo",
    a = "b",
    2 = "four"
  }
}

cowgirl:filter(t, {
  foo = "bar"
})

print(t[1] and t[1].foo) -- bar
print(t[2] and t[2].foo) -- false (t[2] is nil)
```

Note that cowgirl:filter works directly on the table you give to it, so if the table you need it to filter should not change, it is recommended that you unpack or clone it into another table to be processed instead.

For convenience, cowgirl:filter returns the table you passed to it.
